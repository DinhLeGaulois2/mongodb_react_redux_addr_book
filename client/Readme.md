## Add
Every data is about a "**contact**" with contraints. So for each "**contact**", we could have (or not):
> * a **Twitter**,
> * a **Thumbnails**,
> * a **Portraits**,
> * several **Groups**,
> * several **Addresses**,
> * several **Phones**,
> * several **Emails**

## Display
### For a Given CONTACT
Every fields (**Twitter**, **Thumbnails**, **Portraits**, **Groups**, **Addresses**, **Phones**, **Emails**) will be displayed with the **contact**

### As List Of...
Each fields (**Twitter**, **Thumbnails**, **Portraits**, **Groups**, **Addresses**, **Phones**, **Emails**) should be displayed individually.
